This mobile application is pointed out towards students who are in universities particularly who are studying general studies which
requires loads of note-taking. This is a user friendly Application which can be used on any windows and android device including mobile
phones, laptops, tablets.

## Functionality
* Users can create notes
* Users can delete notes
* Users can edit previous notes
* Users can take a picture from the app and attach it to their notes
* Users can create as many notes as there is no limit to creating notes

## Research

* [Xamarin.Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com)
* [YouTube](https://youtube.com)
* YouTube was used to follow tutorials to solve camera permission problems and plugin issues.
* GitHub was used for code snipnets on problem solving issues.
* I found Microsoft Docs very helpful with Xamarin and UI. It's a great guideline for students.
